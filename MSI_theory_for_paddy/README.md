# Sensitivity analysis based on ab-initio calculations

Pre-requisites:
               -- Python 2.7
               -- PAPR-MESS
               -- Numpy
               
               
Example inputs for regular master equation calculations (CH3+OH) and direct abstraction reactions (H2+O2) are provided. To run the code, modify the example input according to your system and the execute using Python.
